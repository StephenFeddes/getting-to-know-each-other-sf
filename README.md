# This project is a website built from HTML and CSS that describes Stephen Feddes. It was programmed by Stephen Feddes. Email: stephenpfeddes@lewisu.edu. 
The project includes the HTML file index.html and the CSS file styles.css.After making the original web page, I improved it by adding padding, borders, special fonts, and an anchor pseudoclass. The pseudoclass causes the hyperlinks to have an underline when a mouse hovers over them. I executed it in Chrome by double clicking on the file in File Explorer. also executed the html file in FireFox by right-clicking on the file and clicking "Open with". I used Windows 10. The picture of me was taken by James Zumhagen in Moab, Utah. Most of the code was handtyped. When I was unsure, for example, how to do the background color, I looked how W3C did it and then I customized the color myself. I would try to handtype as much as I could, but if I couldn't get what I wanted, I used W3C's tutorial for assistance.
